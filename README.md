# EC4304 Project
## Macroeconomic Forecasting Modelling Canada GDP with Time Series Econometrics
This is the time series forecasting project for EC4304. The code is written in Stata, I'm trying to convert it into python or R myself, in the meantime exploring other forecasting techniques that we did not have time to explore during our project term.
